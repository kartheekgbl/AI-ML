# Machine Learning

## Definintion:

Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.

Machine learning algorithms are typically divided into three categories:

**1. Supervised learning:**

- Supervised learning algorithms are trained on labeled data, which means that each data point has a known output.

- For example, a supervised learning algorithm could be trained on a dataset of images of cats and dogs, with each image labeled as either "cat" or "dog".
- Once the algorithm is trained, it can be used to predict the output for new data points, such as an image that the algorithm
  has never seen before.

supervised learning agan classified into two tasks

i. Regression

ii. Classification

### i. Regression:

is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables. It is used to predict a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables

- For example, regression can be used to predict the price of a house based on its square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the location.
- in regression problem output is a number

Here are some examples of regression tasks:

- Predicting the price of a house
- Predicting the number of customers who will visit a store on a given day
- Predicting the temperature on a given day
- Predicting the demand for a product

### ii. Classification

is a statistical process for predicting a class label for a given data point. It is used to predict a discrete outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables

- For example, classification can be used to predict whether an email is spam or not spam, whether a customer will churn or not, or whether a patient has a particular disease.
- in regression problem output is a number

Here are some examples of regression tasks:

- Predicting whether an email is spam or not spam
- Predicting whether a customer will churn or not
- Predicting whether a patient has a particular disease
- Predicting whether a product is defective or not

**2. Unsupervised learning:**

- Unsupervised learning algorithms are trained on unlabeled data, which means that the data points do not have known outputs.
- For example, an unsupervised learning algorithm could be trained on a dataset of images of different types of flowers.
- The algorithm would then try to find hidden patterns in the data, such as grouping the images into different clusters based on the color and shape of the flowers.

**3. Reinforcement learning:**

- Reinforcement learning algorithms learn by trial and error.

- The algorithm is rewarded for taking actions that lead to desired outcomes and penalized for taking actions that lead to undesired outcomes.
- Over time, the algorithm learns to take the actions that are most likely to lead to desired outcomes.
