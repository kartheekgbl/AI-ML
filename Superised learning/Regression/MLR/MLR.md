## Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression is closely related to a simple linear regression model with the different in the number of independent variables.

The SLR pridicts the output based on one value of single independent variable but MLR predicts the output based on multiple Independend variables

### Assumptions of multiple linear Regression

1. **Linearity**: The relationship between dependent and independent variables should be linear
2. **Lack of Multicollinearity**: Is is assumed that there is littele or no multicolliniarity in the data. Multicollinearity occurs when the features (or independent variables) are not independent of each other
3. **Multivariate Normality**: Multiple regression assumes that the residuals are normally distributed
