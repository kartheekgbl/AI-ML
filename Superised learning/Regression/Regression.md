### i. Regression:

is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables. It is used to predict a continuous outcome variable based on one or more predictor variables

- For example, regression can be used to predict the price of a house based on its square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the location.
- in regression problem output is a number

Here are some examples of regression tasks:

- Predicting the price of a house
- Predicting the number of customers who will visit a store on a given day
- Predicting the temperature on a given day
- Predicting the demand for a product

| Type of Regression       | Advantage                                                           | Diadvantages                                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Linear regression        | Simple to understand and implement                                  | Only models linear relationships                          |
| Polynomial regression    | Can model non-linear relationships                                  | Can be complex and overfit the data                       |
| Ridge regression         | Helps to prevent overfitting                                        | Can be computationally expensive                          |
| Lasso regression         | Helps to prevent overfitting and can be used for feature selection  | Can be sensitive to the choice of regularization paramete |
| Decision tree regression | Non-parametric and robust to outliers                               | Can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters         |
| Random forest regression | Ensemble learning algorithm that produces more accurate predictions | Can be computationally expensive                          |
